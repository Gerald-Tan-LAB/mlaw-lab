---

You can make payment through the following methods:

1. Come down in person to LAB to pay using either **Cash or Nets**. You will not need to take a Queue Number for making payment.

2. Send a cheque or money order for the amount to us. All cheques or money orders should be **crossed** and made payable to the **Director of Legal Aid**. Please ensure that your name, NRIC and case reference number are written on the reverse of the cheque or money order.  Please do not send cash by post.

3. Pay online at [https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/labesvc/](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/labesvc/){:target="_blank"}. Select “For Applicant” and log in to the ePortal using your Singpass. Click on “Check My Payment”.
