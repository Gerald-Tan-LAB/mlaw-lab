Taking the Merits Test
---

The Merits Test assesses whether you have a reasonable case to bring or defend in court. 

After Statement Taking is done, and all the neessary documents for your case have been received by LAB, a lawyer will be assigned to investigate your case. He may ask for further information and documents from you to understand your case better. He will then put up an opinion one the merits of your case. This opinion will be put before the Legal Aid Board for their consideration on whether to grant you legal aid.<br>
