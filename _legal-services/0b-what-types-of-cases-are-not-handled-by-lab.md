What types of cases are not handled by LAB?
---

**Criminal Proceedings**

LAB does not handle criminal proceedings.

If you require legal advice or representation in criminal proceedings, you may wish to approach the Law Society of Singapore which administers the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.

**Certain Civil Proceedings**

LAB also does not handle certain civil proceedings including the following:

* Defamation cases
* Proceedings before the Small Claims Tribunal and the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents
* Proceedings in the Family Court for maintenance and personal protection orders where the opposing party is not legally represented

**Directorâ€™s Discretion**

The Director of Legal Aid may refuse legal aid if it appears to him unreasonable that the applicant should receive it in the particular circumstances of the case.
