How do I apply for LAB's Services?
---

**1. Overview of LAB's Application Process for Legal Aid and Assistance**<br>

IMAGE

Please note that this is a general overview of the LAB's application process for legal aid and assistance. Your application may be processed differently, depending on the facts of your case.

For legal advice matters, you need to register and attend at LAB to see the Duty Lawyer. Other than the preliminary means test, there are no other processes such as statement taking, merits test, etc.

<sup>*</sup> This process may be different if your case involves an application for legal aid where a child has been removed/abducted from Singapore or removed/abducted to Singapore under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

Please see (11) below for further information. 


**2. How do I register for LAB's services?**<br>

If you require legal aid, assistance, or advice, you can either*:

(a) Register your case online at <a href="https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/labesvc/">https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/labesvc/</a>

For the online registration, you will be required to complete a preliminary assessment of your financial eligibility for legal aid ("preliminary means assessment"). Once you have passed the means assessment and successfully registered your case, you will be asked to attend at LAB **within 2 working days**.

Or

(b) Come to LAB during office hours (8.30 am to 5.00 pm) on weekdays to make an application. Please note that LAB is closed on weekends and public holidays.

<sup>*</sup> If you are a minor (i.e. a person below 21 years of age), your parent or guardian must apply on your behalf.  


**3. What are the benefits of registering online?**<br>

If you register online, you will be immediately placed in the queue to see the Duty Lawyer for your matter. You will not need to tell our staff about the facts or your case or answer questions about your financial situation (“preliminary means test”).


**4. What happens when I attend at LAB?**<br>

**If you are registering in-person at LAB**, you will be asked some basic questions about the facts of your case and your financial situation (“preliminary means test”), to determine your eligibility for legal aid.
  
If your matter is within LAB’s scope of work and you pass the preliminary means test, then:

(a) If you only need legal advice, you will be able to consult the Duty Lawyer

(b) If you only need legal assistance to draft a Will or Deed of Separation, a file will be opened for you

(c) If you need legal representation in court proceedings, a file will be opened for you for straightforward cases. If your matter is complex or if you require legal advice, you will be able to consult the Duty Lawyer first, who will assess whether a file should be opened for your matter. 

**If you have registered online**, please inform us that you have registered a case online and provide us with your case reference number. You will not need to tell our staff about the facts of your case or do the preliminary means test. You will immediately be placed in the queue to see the Duty Lawyer. 
  
  
**5. What happens when I see the Duty Lawyer?**<br>

The Duty Lawyer will give you oral advice on questions relating to Singapore law and suggest practical steps you may take in your case. He may ask you for more information and documents, in order to advise you properly. If necessary, the lawyer will also assess if your matter is one LAB can help to represent you in Court for. If it is, then the lawyer will direct the counter staff to open a file for you and give you an appointment for the full Means Test.

<sup>*</sup> Please note that this initial assessment does NOT mean that legal aid has been or will be granted to you. 

For legal aid to be granted to you, you will still need to pass both the full Means Test (which assesses your financial eligibility for legal aid) and the Merits Test (which assesses whether you have a reasonable case to bring or defend in court).


**6. What happens during the Means Test?**<br>

The Means Test is an assessment of whether you are financially eligible for legal aid. 

During the Means Test, you must make full and frank disclosure of your means. Failure to do so is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or with imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both. 

<sup>*</sup> There will be changes to the Means Test, pursuant to the Legal Aid and Advice (Amendment) Bill, and this website will be updated accordingly when the changes are in force. 

If you pass the Means Test, then you will be given an appointment for Statement Taking.


**7. What happens during the Statement Taking?**<br>

You will be interviewed by a Legal Executive from LAB during the Statement Taking who will ask you questions about your case. You should provide LAB with the full facts of your case as well as all the relevant documents/evidence. This helps LAB to investigate your case and assess whether legal aid should be granted to you. 


**8. What documents should I bring for the Means Test and Statement Taking?**<br>

**9. Will LAB represent me immediately after I have applied for aid or after Statement Taking?**<br>

No. After your legal aid application, you will need to pass the <a href="/legal-services/taking-the-means-test/">Means Test</a>, before the Statement Taking. After your statement is taken, LAB will need to investigate your case and assess if legal aid should be granted to you. This assessment ("the Merits Test") is done by the Legal Aid Board.

You can find out more about the <a href="/legal-services/taking-the-merits-test/">Merits Test</a> here. 

You will be informed of the Board's decision on whether you have been granted legal aid once the decision has been made. 

In urgent cases (for example where there are ongoing court proceedings), LAB may represent you under a Provisional Grant of Aid ("PGA") even before you have passed the Merits Test. This PGA will continue/be renewed until the Board makes a decision for your case.


**10. How long do I have to wait from the Statement Taking to the decision on whether I have been granted aid?**<br>

This depends on the complexity of your case and the amount of time needed for investigations. For fairly straightforward cases, it will usually take about four months before the decision is made on whether to grant you aid. 

You must inform us if Court proceedings have been commenced in your case, whether by yoursself or against you, and/or whether your case requires urgent attention (for any other reason). This is so that, if necessary, we can give you help even before the decision is made on whether to grant you aid.  


**11. My child has been removed from Singapore or removed/abducted to Singapore. How can I apply for legal aid?**<br>

If you are not a resident in Singapore or if your child has been removed from Singapore, please approach the Singapore Central Authority to assist you. You will be required to complete "Form 1-Application for Legal Aid for matters relating to the HCCAICA" and submit it to the said Authority.

For more information on the Singapore Central Authority and the application process for the return of abducted children under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, you may refer to the Ministry of Social and Family Development's website: https://www.msf.gov.sg/Singapore-Central-Authority/Pages/Application-Process.aspx

If you are a resident in Singapore, please come to LAB persoanlly during office hours (8.30 am to 5.00 pm) on weekdays to make an application for legal aid or advice.
