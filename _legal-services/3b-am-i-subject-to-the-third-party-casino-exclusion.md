Am I subject to the Third-Party Casino Exclusion?
---

From 1 August 2013, if you are granted legal aid, you will be subject to Third-Party Casino Exclusion. Under Third-Party Casino Exclusion, you shall not enter or remain, or take part in any gaming on any local casino premises. The Third-Party Casino Exclusion will remain in force until all your active legal aid cases are closed. Please note that until the casino operator is so notified of the termination of your Third-Party Casino Exclusion, you can be refused entry into the local casinos. For more information on Casino Exclusion, please call the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1800 6668 668.
