Grant of Aid by the Legal Aid Board
---

The Legal Aid Board comprises the Director of Legal Aid and at least two independent solicitors who are on LAB's Panel of Assigned Solicitors.

If the Board is of the view that your case has merits, i.e. you have a reasonable case to bring or defend in court, then it will decide to grant you legal aid.

However, if the Board is of the view that your case does not have merits, i.e. you do not have a reasonable case to bring or defend in court, then it will decide not to grant you legal aid.

LAB will send you a letter letting you know whether you have been granted legal aid. If you have not been granted legal aid, then the letter will briefly explain the reasons for this. 

All decisions of the Legal Aid Board in respect of applications for legal aid are final.
