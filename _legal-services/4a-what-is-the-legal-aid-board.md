Grant By Legal Aid Board
---

The Legal Aid Board comprises the Director of Legal Aid as well as at least two other independent assigned solicitors.

After your lawyer has investigated into your case, your lawyer will prepare an opinion on the merits of your case (that is, whether you have a good chance of succeeding in your case). This opinion will be put forward before the Board.

If the Board is of the view that your case has merits, then you have passed the [Merits Test](/legal-services/taking-the-merits-test/) and your application for legal aid is approved.

If the Board is of the view that your case does not have merits, then your application for legal aid is refused. A letter will be sent to you explaining the reasons of the Board for refusing to grant aid to you.

The decision of the Board is final.
