<b> <u>What are the duties of an Assigned Solicitor? </u> </b> <br>
Private lawyers or Assigned Solicitors who volunteer their time and services have been a key pillar of the Legal Aid Scheme since its inception. <br>

The Director of Legal Aid is empowered to maintain a panel of Assigned Solicitors who are willing to: <br>

* investigate, report and give an opinion on whether legal aid should be granted, upon an application for legal aid;
* act for persons receiving legal aid; and
* give legal advice under the provisions of the Act. <br>


**[The Assigned Solicitorâ€™s Guide (436KB)](/files/LAB-AS-Guide.pdf)** <br>
*The Assigned Solicitor's Guide does not reflect the new amendments to the Legal Aid and Advice Act and the Legal Aid and Advice Regulations. We will be uploading an amended version of the Guide shortly.* <br>

 
<b> <u>How do I sign up as an Assigned Solicitor? </u> </b> <br>
